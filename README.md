# Predicting-House-Price
Build a Linear Regression Model using Scikit -learn
This project demonstrates how to build a Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn to predict house prices based on several features. The dataset used for this project is the Ames Housing Dataset, which includes features like Number of bedrooms, square footage, year built, garage size, and many categorical and continuous features.Size: ~2,900 records
Technologies
